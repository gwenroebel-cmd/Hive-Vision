# Control Hub (OpenCV + Lab)

Two model-free hub tracks: `cv/TeamCode/BallDetectorPipeline.java` (HSV) and `lab/TeamCode/LabBallDetectorPipeline.java` (Lab chromaticity), both extending the shared base `cv/TeamCode/BallBlobPipeline.java`. Setup, tuning commands, and viewer tools are in [cv/README.md](https://github.com/sidhuharjas/Hive-Vision/blob/main/cv/README.md) and [lab/README.md](https://github.com/sidhuharjas/Hive-Vision/blob/main/lab/README.md), or follow the step-by-step: [Set up the HSV track](hub_hsv_setup.md) · [Set up the Lab track](hub_lab_setup.md). This page covers the decision and what to expect from the outputs.

## Pick

* **Lab** when balls sit in shadows; **HSV** when you want the cheapest path on a stable-lighting field.
* A ball deep in shadow is too desaturated for _any_ color-only detector — that case belongs to the Limelight 3A track.

## What to know

* Expect **7–11% precision** on a real field. The hub outputs are candidates — confirm each across several frames before the robot acts.
* Both pipelines were fit/tuned from YOLO reference detections on published footage; re-check recall on _your_ field's white balance before relying on them.
