# 5-minute quick start — Control Hub CV (HSV)

The model-free track: no Limelight, no TensorFlow, no model — a pure color-threshold `VisionProcessor` runs on the Control Hub itself and reports ball _candidates_.

> **Candidate detector, not a guaranteed detector.** Measured precision on the dev video: yellow 40%, red 26%, blue 66%. Treat every blob as a candidate — require 3–5 consecutive frames at the same normalized position before the robot acts on it.

## What you need

| Thing                                                                         | What it's for                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cv/TeamCode/BallBlobPipeline.java` + `cv/TeamCode/BallDetectorPipeline.java` | the `VisionProcessor` drop-in + the base class it extends |
| `cv/tools/hsv_tuned.json`                                                     | shipped HSV config (ranges + gates)                       |
| FTC SDK project with a USB webcam                                             | `VisionPortal` + EasyOpenCV                               |

## 1. Copy the pipeline

Copy `cv/TeamCode/BallBlobPipeline.java` (the base class) **and** `cv/TeamCode/BallDetectorPipeline.java` from this repo into your FTC project's `TeamCode/` folder (same level as your OpModes).

## 2. Register it in an OpMode

```java
import org.firstinspires.ftc.vision.VisionPortal;
import org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.hardware.camera.WebcamName;
import org.opencv.core.Size;

BallDetectorPipeline baller = new BallDetectorPipeline();

VisionPortal portal = new VisionPortal.Builder()
        .setCamera(hardwareMap.get(WebcamName.class, "Webcam 1"))
        .setCameraResolution(new Size(1280, 720))
        .addProcessor(baller)
        .enableLiveView(true)
        .build();
```

The `"Webcam 1"` string must match your Driver Station camera config name.

## 3. Read detections each loop

```java
BallDetectorPipeline.BallBlob red = baller.bestOf(BallDetectorPipeline.BallColor.RED);
if (red != null) {
    telemetry.addData("red", "cx=%.2f cy=%.2f", red.cxNorm, red.cyNorm);
}
```

`bestOf(...)` returns `null` when no blob of that color passes the gates, and a `BallBlob` with `cxNorm` / `cyNorm` (0–1 screen-relative, centered) otherwise. Colors are `BallColor.YELLOW`, `BallColor.RED`, `BallColor.BLUE`.

## 4. Check your resolution

The shipped area constants were tuned at 1920×1080. At any other resolution, scale them by the pixel-count ratio:

```
scale = (W_new * H_new) / (1920 * 1080)
```

At 1280×720 that's ×0.444 — `MIN_AREA_PX` 900 → 400, `MAX_AREA_PX` 12000 → 5300. Adjust the same three constants in `BallDetectorPipeline.java` before deploying at a different resolution. The full table is in [Set up the HSV track](detector_tracks/control_hub/hub_hsv_setup.md).

## 5. Verify in 5 minutes

1. Deploy the OpMode and open the Driver Station **camera stream** (live view).
2. Point the webcam at a yellow ball. You should see a colored outline box + centroid lock onto it.
3. Slide the ball across the view — `cxNorm` should move 0 → 1 across the frame (0.5 ≈ center).
4. Repeat for red and blue. If the wrong color lights up, keep the field white-balanced and re-check `BallColor`.
5. Once blobs track reliably, gate them in code: only act when a blob stays within a small `cxNorm`/`cyNorm` window for 3–5 frames.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                           | First thing to check                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No blobs anywhere                 | Webcam name matches config; white balance on; `MIN_AREA_PX` too high for your resolution                                         |
| Blobs flicker / appear everywhere | Field white balance; deep shadows (that's the [Lab](quick_start_lab.md) track's job); raise the per-frame frame-consistency gate |
| Wrong color detected              | Keep red vs blue luminance distinct; retune with `python cv/tools/hsv_tuner.py path/to/frame.jpg`                                |

## You're ready when

* [ ] The live stream draws a box over each ball color
* [ ] `bestOf(...).cxNorm/cyNorm` track the ball across the frame
* [ ] The 3–5 frame confirmation gate keeps one target when balls move
