# 5-minute quick start — Control Hub Lab

The shadow-robust, model-free track: CIELAB chromaticity (hue + an adaptive chroma floor) separates "what color" from "how bright", so a ball sitting in a mid shadow keeps its hue — where the HSV track reads it as a different color, Lab mostly still works.

> **Candidate detector, not a guaranteed detector.** Same contract as the HSV track — confirm each blob across 3–5 frames before the robot acts.

## What you need

| Thing                                                                              | What it's for                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lab/TeamCode/BallBlobPipeline.java` + `lab/TeamCode/LabBallDetectorPipeline.java` | the `VisionProcessor` drop-in + the base class it extends |
| `lab/tools/lab_tuned.json`                                                         | shipped learned constants                                 |
| FTC SDK project with a USB webcam                                                  | `VisionPortal` + EasyOpenCV                               |

## 1. Copy the pipeline

Copy `lab/TeamCode/BallBlobPipeline.java` (the base class) **and** `lab/TeamCode/LabBallDetectorPipeline.java` into your FTC project's `TeamCode/` folder.

## 2. Register it in an OpMode

```java
import org.firstinspires.ftc.vision.VisionPortal;
import org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcore.external.hardware.camera.WebcamName;
import org.opencv.core.Size;

LabBallDetectorPipeline pipeline = new LabBallDetectorPipeline();

VisionPortal portal = new VisionPortal.Builder()
        .setCamera(hardwareMap.get(WebcamName.class, "Webcam 1"))
        .setCameraResolution(new Size(1280, 720))
        .addProcessor(pipeline)
        .build();
```

## 3. Read detections each loop

```java
LabBallDetectorPipeline.BallBlob ball = pipeline.bestOf(LabBallDetectorPipeline.BallColor.YELLOW);
if (ball != null) {
    telemetry.addData("ball", "cx=%.2f cy=%.2f", ball.cxNorm, ball.cyNorm);
}
```

`bestOf(...)` returns `null` when nothing of that color passes the gates, and a `BallBlob` with `cxNorm` / `cyNorm` (0–1 screen-relative, centered) otherwise. Colors are `BallColor.YELLOW`, `BallColor.RED`, `BallColor.BLUE`.

## 4. Resolution — nothing to do

Unlike the HSV track, the Lab area gates are stored per-1080p and scale **automatically** to the live camera resolution, so 1280×720 just works.

## 5. Verify in 5 minutes

1. Deploy the OpMode and open the Driver Station **camera stream**.
2. Point the webcam at a yellow ball — first in full light, then with the ball pushed partly into a shadow. The blob should stay on the ball in both.
3. Slide it across the view: `cxNorm` should move 0 → 1 across the frame.
4. Repeat for red and blue.
5. Gate in code like the HSV track: only act on a blob that keeps its `cxNorm`/`cyNorm` position for 3–5 consecutive frames.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                         | First thing to check                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No blobs anywhere               | Webcam name matches config; white balance on; `MIN_L` floor too high for your lighting                                                      |
| Same as HSV track               | That's expected on a stable-lighting field — the two should agree                                                                           |
| A ball deep in shadow is missed | A ball so dark it loses chroma entirely is beyond _any_ color-only detector — that case belongs to the [Limelight 3A track](quick_start.md) |

## You're ready when

* [ ] The live stream keeps a blob on a ball in both light and mid-shadow
* [ ] `bestOf(...).cxNorm/cyNorm` track the ball across the frame
* [ ] The 3–5 frame confirmation gate holds one target while balls move
